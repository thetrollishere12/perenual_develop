I recently updated our API data for many sections like propagation, hardiness zones and other areas. I'm thinking of phasing out fruiting season so just a heads up unless you find it useful plz let me know.

I have also created a log page where you can keep up to date to what im doing with the api - https://perenual.com/docs/api/logs

If you'd like to provide feedback, please feel free to reply to this email and share your thoughts.I will update again in a 1-2 months about the next update.

Thank you! - the guy that made the siteğŸ˜€";
